     <h1>Basketball Rules</h1>
     <p>Basketball dates back as far as 1891 and since then has <br> evolved into a sport played around the world. Many<br> countries have adopted the game such as Russia, Great <br> Britain, Germany, Spain and parts of Asia, but it is<br> America where the biggest and most lucrative league in<br> the world lives: the NBA (National Basketball Association).</p>
     <h2>Rules of Basketball<h2></h2>
     <ul>
    <li>Each team can have a maximum of 5 players on the court at any one time. Substitutions can be<br> made as many times as they wish within the game.</li>
    <li>The ball can only be moved by either dribbling (bouncing the ball) or passing the ball. Once a<br> player puts two hands on the ball (not including catching the ball) they cannot then dribble or<br> move with the ball and the ball must be passed or shot.</li>
    <li>After the ball goes into a teamâ€™s half and they win possession back the ball must then make it<br> back over the half way line within 10 seconds. If the ball fails to do so then a foul will be called<br> and the ball will be turned over.</li>
    <li>Each team has 24 seconds to at least shot at the basket. A shot constitutes either going in the<br> basket or hitting the rim of the basket. If after the shot is taken and the ball fails to go in the<br> basket then the shot clock is restarted for another 24 seconds.</li>
    <li>The team trying to score a basket is called the offence whilst the team trying to prevent them<br>from scoring is called the defence. The defence must do all they can to stop the offence from<br> scoring by either blocking a shot or preventing a shot from being fired.</li>
    <li>After each successful basket the ball is then turned over to the opposition</li> 
    <li>Fouls committed throughout the game will be accumulated and then when reached a certain<br> number will be eventually be awarded as a free throw. A free throw involves one playerfrom the<br> offensive team (the player fouled) to take a shot unopposed from the free throw line. Depending<br> on where the foul was committed will depend on the number free throws a player gets</li>
    <li>Violations in basketball include travelling (taking more than one step without bouncing the ball),<br> double dribble (picking the ball up dribbling, stopping then dribbling again with two hands),<br> goaltending (a defensive player interferes with the ball travelling downwards towards the basket)<br> and back court violation (once the ball passes the half way line the offensive team cannot take<br> the ball back over the half way line).</li>
</ul>
     <h2>Object of the Game</h2>
     <p>The object of basketball is to throw the ball (basketball)<br> into a hoop to score points. The game is played out on a rectangular court and depending on which<br> section of court you successfully throw a ball into the basket will depend on how many points are<br> scored. The ball can be moved around the by dribbling or passing the ball. At the end of the game the team<br> with the most points is declared the winner.</p>
      <h2>Winning The Game</h2>
      <p>Winning a game of basketball is pretty simple; score more points than your opponents in the allotted<br> game time. If the scores are tied at the end then an extra quarter will be played until a winner is found.</p>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>There are three scoring numbers for basketball players. Any basket scored from outside the three point<br>arc will result in three points being scored. Baskets scored within the three point arc will result in two<br> points being scored. Successful free throws will result in 1 point being scored per free throw. The<br> number of free throws will depend on where the foul was committed.</p>
      <h2>Players & Equipment</h2>
     <p>Each team is made up of 12 players with only 5 allowed on the court at any time. The positions are<br> broken up into Point Guard, Defensive Guard, Center, Offensive forward and Defensive Forward. Each<br> player will then take up a position on the court but are allowed to move around as they please.<br><br>

        The court is a rectangular shaped and measures 91 feet long and 50 feet wide. There is a halfway line<br>in which a small circle is found in the centre; this is where the game starts with a tip off (the ball is<br> thrown in the air by the referee and a player from each team tries to win possession for their team). At<br> each end of the court are two baskets both 10 feet in height. A three point arc is the outside ring, whilst<br> in the middle of that is the key which includes a free throw line.<br><br>
        
        All that is needed to play is a court and basketball. Teams must wear matching strips with some<br> players choosing to wear gum shields and face masks for protection.<br><br>
        
        The game is split up into 4 twelve minute quarters. In between the 2 nd and 3rd quarter is a 15 minute<br> half time interval.</p>

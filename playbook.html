        <h3><u>Shooting Drill 1: "12 Sets Drill"</u></h3>
        <img src="https://cccdn-fe9e.kxcdn.com/images/12SetsShootingDrill.PNG" alt="playbook" >
      <p>Have players partner-up and use all of your baskets. Each player will shoot 12 sets of shots. Each set consists of a 3-pointer (yellow), a shot-fake with jump shot (green), a catch and shoot jump shot (blue), and a lay-up (pink).</p>
      <p>We start in one corner and rotate around each of the 12 spots (seen in black in the diagram). The partner rebounds and passes back to the shooter. We switch the shooter/rebounder after those four shots are taken, both players getting to shoot at the same spot before moving to the next spot.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-quarter">
        <h3><u>Shooting Drill 2: "3-2-1"</u></h3>
        <img src="https://cccdn-fe9e.kxcdn.com/images/321Shooting.GIF" alt="playbook" >
      <p>This is a fun competitive drill. Players partner-up, Use all of your baskets. Each player shoots nine sets of shots (see diagram). Each set consists of a 3-pointer, a shot-fake with jump shot, and a lay-up. We start in one corner and rotate around each of the nine spots (seen in black in the diagram).</p>
      <p>The partner rebounds and passes back to the shooter. We rotate shooters after each set (spot) of "3-2-1", so the shooter becomes the rebounder and vice-versa. The two players compete against each other and keep track of their individual scores. Each made 3-pointer = 3 points, a jump shot = 2 points, and a lay-up = 1 point. The loser does push-ups.</p>

        <h3><u>Shooting Drill 3: "45" Shooting</u></h3>
        <img src="https://cccdn-fe9e.kxcdn.com/images/45Shooting.GIF" alt="playbook">
      <p>This is another fun, challenging drill. Use both baskets with half of the team at each end. Each player shoots nine sets of shots. We start in one corner and rotate around each of the nine spots (seen in black in the diagram). Each set consists of a 3-pointer and a mid-range jump shot.</p>
      <p>A rebounder rebounds the 3-point shot and passes back to the shooter who shot fakes and shoots a mid-range jumper. After the jump shot, the shooter becomes the rebounder for the next shooter. Each player keeps track of his/her own score. Three-pointers = 3 points and mid-range jumpers = 2 points.</p>

        <h3><u>Shooting Drill 4: "Celtic Drill"</u></h3>
        <img src="https://cccdn-fe9e.kxcdn.com/images/CelticDrill.png" alt="Playbook">
      <p>This drill comes from Archie Miller . You can do this with two or three players - one shooter and the other(s) rebounding for the shooter. The shooter starts in one corner (see diagram below). There are five shooting spots. He/she must make two in a row at each spot before moving on to the next spot. Once the shooter reaches the opposite corner and makes two there, he/she then stays there and makes two more and moves on.</p>
      <p>The goal is to get all the way around and back within two minutes. If a player makes it in less than two minutes, the time is recorded and then next time he/she will try to beat the previous record. Also, if the shooter gets around in less than two minutes, he/she keeps going for the entire two minutes to see how far he/she can get - maybe to spot 12 or 13 for example.</p>

      <h3><u>2-on-0 Passing Drills</u></h3>
      <img src="https://cccdn-fe9e.kxcdn.com/images/2on0A.PNG" alt="playbook">
      <p>See the diagram Above. Players pair up and run (not shuffle sideways) up the floor passing back and forth to each other. The last pass is a bounce pass and results in a lay-up.</p>
      <p>That pair gets off the court and lines up on the far baseline now, getting ready to come back down the court after all the other pairs have finished. After all pairs have moved up the floor, we then start back down the court to complete the trip both ways.</p>
      <p>We run several trips, starting with crisp two-handed chest passes up and back. Then we do bounce passes up and back. Next, we do two-handed overhead passes and finally around-the-back passes up and back.</p>

      <h3><u>2-on-1 Drill</u></h3>
      <img src="https://cccdn-fe9e.kxcdn.com/images/2on0B.GIF" alt="playbook">
      <p>See the middle diagram below. Now we add a defender who sprints ahead of the two passers to the paint and tries to defend in a 2-on-1 situation.</p>
      <p>However, the defender may try to jump between the passers anywhere on the floor to steal the pass. If the ball is stolen or there is a turnover or a missed pass, the three players just move into line at the far end of the floor. When the last three-some has finished, we come back down the court to complete the trip.</p>

      <h3><u>Press Break Passing</u></h3>
      <img src="https://cccdn-fe9e.kxcdn.com/images/PressBreakPassDrill1.png" alt="playbook">
      <p>This drill teaches players facing full-court pressure and a trap, not to panic, to locate a receiver and make a good, crisp pass. Often the first pass after the inbounds pass is the crucial pass in breaking the press, and is also the one often intercepted by the defense. This drill practices the inbounds pass reception and the first pass up the court, either to the center on the ball-side sideline. And we can also use it to learn how to deal with the trap itself.</p>
      <p>Use three lines for the offensive players (yellow). Use three defenders (assistants). Have two set the trap, after allowing the inbounds pass. Have the third defender play the gap between the two offensive receivers and try to intercept the pass. You could use a manager or coach to make the inbounds pass <a href="https://www.coachesclipboard.net/PressBreakPassingDrill.html"> Click to keep Reading</a></p>

      <h3><u>(2-on-1 with a chaser)</u></h3>
      <img src="https://cccdn-fe9e.kxcdn.com/images/2on0C.GIF" alt="playbook">
      <p>Finally, we finish by adding a second defender who trails the break and may not leave the end-line until the offense has cleared the top of the key or 3-point arc. The first defender sprints up the floor and tries to stop, or delay, the 2-on-1 break, while the second defender is sprinting up the floor to provide defensive help at the end.</p>
      <p>The offense must move quickly and make quick decisions, otherwise they lose their 2-on-1 advantage. Both offensive and defensive players should be "talking", communicating.</p>
